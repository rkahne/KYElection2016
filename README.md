# KYElection2016

This project provides a Shiny App of showing the results of the 2016 General Election in Kentucky.

###What's There Now
The files in this project are csv results of the major Jefferson County elections, and the source of the Shiny App for creating them.  
The precinct level shapefile is not included in this project.  I received it from [LOJIC](http://www.lojic.org/), but based on my lack of legal expertise, I am unsure if the license I posess allows me to share the file.  
If you want the shapefile, though, feel free to email me at rkahne at gmail.com.  Just let me know you aren't using it for commercial purposes.

###What Might Be There Soon
I would like to receive a precinct level map of the whole state, or for more counties, and replicate this project for other geographies.
Let me know if you have other ideas.
