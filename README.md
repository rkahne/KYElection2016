# KYElection2016

https://rkahne.shinyapps.io/Election2016/

This project provides a Shiny App of showing the results of the 2016 General Election in Kentucky.

### What's There Now
The files in this project are csv results of the major elections in Jefferson, Fayette, and Boone Counties in KY, and the source of the Shiny App for creating them.  
I received the shapefiles for this project from the county clerk's offices, with the exception of Jefferson County, KY.  In Jefferson County, [LOJIC](http://www.lojic.org/) handles the mapping.  They charge to received data.  Lexington's data is mostly open, and available through their [data portal](http://data.lexingtonky.gov/).  I recevied the Boone County file by emailing their clerk.
If you download any of these shapefiles, please do not use them for commercial purposes.

### What Might Be There Soon
I would like to receive a precinct level map of the whole state, or for more counties, and replicate this project for other geographies.
Let me know if you have other ideas.
